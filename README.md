# Reset

Over the years, I've used many CSS resets, starting with Eric Meyer's version. Andy Bell also offers a good one, but I find that I don't need all of it and don't necessarily agree with every aspect. I want to take my reset a step further by adding sensible accessibility defaults, such as focus styles, smooth scrolling, and features to enhance readability. This CSS stylesheet reflects my personal preferences; you don't have to use itâ€”feel free to adopt only what you like.
